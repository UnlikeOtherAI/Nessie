//! What the Nessie Executor service and its tray both have to agree on.
//!
//! Three facts, and all are the kind that break silently when they are stated
//! twice: the account Windows derives from the service name — pick the two
//! separately and the grant names an account that never exists — the layout
//! under `%ProgramData%` that the tray writes into and the service reads out
//! of, and the string form of a SID, which the tray writes as a file name and
//! the service reads back and hands to Win32.
//!
//! The names and the validation are portable, so they are tested on any host.
//! The one Win32 call lives behind `cfg(windows)` in [`sid`].
