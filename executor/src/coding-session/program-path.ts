/**
 * Where a bare program name — the configured `claude`, `git`, `gh` — is
 * found: the absolute entries of the environment's own `PATH`, in order, and
 * nowhere else.
 *
 * Left to itself, Windows looks in the child's working directory before
 * `PATH` (libuv's search for `execFile` and `spawn`, and `CreateProcessW`'s
 * inside the job helper), and that directory is the session's folder: a
 * repository the agent edits. A `claude.exe` committed there, or written by
 * the agent during a turn, would be what the next start, the next resume and
 * every probe ran, a program the reviewed configuration never named. POSIX
 * `execvp` honours a relative `PATH` entry, which is relative to that same
 * folder. So a program is resolved once, to an absolute path, before
 * anything runs it, and a name with a directory in it that is not absolute is
 * not resolved at all.
