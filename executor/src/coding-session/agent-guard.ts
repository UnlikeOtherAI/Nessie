/**
 * `nessie-executor coding-session-agent-guard`: what ends an agent whose host
 * died, where nothing else would.
 *
 * A packaged Windows host has the job helper's Job Object, which ends the job
 * when the host dies, and a Linux host in its own systemd user unit has the
 * unit's cgroup. Everywhere else — macOS, Linux without a user manager (or
 * whose unit was refused), a Windows development run — a host killed with -9
 * or by the OOM killer left its agent finishing the turn it was in, editing
 * the worktree unobserved. There the host starts the agent through this guard.
 *
 * The guard inherits one extra pipe from the host, at fd 3 (Node's IPC
 * channel), and gets the agent's argv, folder and environment on it — never
 * on its command line. It starts the agent as its own child in a process
 * group of its own (detached on POSIX; hidden on Windows), reports the
 * agent's pid and start time back on that pipe, and only then relays stdin,
 * stdout and stderr. When the pipe closes the host is gone, however it went:
 * the guard kills the agent's group and tree — SIGTERM, then SIGKILL three
 * seconds later on POSIX, pid by pid on Windows, each checked by its start
 * time as every kill is — and exits. On Windows that kill is a PowerShell the
 * guard starts as soon as the agent has an identity and holds ready (it
 * exits with the guard), because a cold one took most of the five seconds on
 * a loaded machine.
 *
 * Otherwise it is transparent. The recorded identity is the agent's own, so
 * every kill the host makes reaches the agent as before and never the guard;
 * the guard exits with the agent's code (or signal) once the agent's output
 * is read, and its own refusals go to stderr as `EXECUTOR_GUARD_*` codes with
 * exit code 125, as the job helper's do. The end of the agent's input is sent
 * on the pipe as well as by closing stdin, because a dead host closes both:
 * stdin alone ending means the host is gone, not that the agent should finish
 * its turn.
