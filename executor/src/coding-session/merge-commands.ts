 * Which pull-request commands Claude Code may run without being asked, for
 * the signed `mergeCommands` fact, and whether it may run any command at all
 * unasked, for the signed `unaskedCommands` fact
 * (docs/executor-protocol/host-coding-sessions.md).
 *
 * Read from the reviewed configuration the way Claude Code reads a Bash
 * permission rule, and never more generously: `Bash`, `Bash(*)` and
 * `Bash(:*)` cover every command; `Bash(git push:*)` and `Bash(git *)` cover a
 * command that is that prefix or starts with it and a space; `Bash(gi*)`
 * covers one that starts with the prefix. An exact `Bash(git push)` covers
 * only the bare command, which never pushes a branch, so it does not count,
 * and a pattern with a wildcard anywhere but its end is not understood here,
 * so it does not count either. A `disallowedTools` entry that covers a command
 * takes it back, as it does in Claude Code. `bypassPermissions` runs
 * everything unasked.
