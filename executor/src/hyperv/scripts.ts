 * its SHA-256 is recorded in the package's own `resources/manifest.json`. The
 * backend refuses to run one whose bytes differ, so a person who can write into
 * Program Files still cannot turn `create.ps1` into something else the daemon
 * will run as itself.
 *
 * Nothing is ever composed into a command string. Every invocation is
 * `powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File
 * <script> -Param <value> …` as an argv array, and with `-File` PowerShell
 * binds the remaining arguments to the script's own parameters instead of
 * parsing them as expressions — so a workspace path can never become code.
