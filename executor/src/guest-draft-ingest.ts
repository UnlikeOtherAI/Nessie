 * image the host cannot read, so the draft comes back over the control channel
 * instead — and the host never parses a filesystem the guest wrote. Every path
 * the guest names is re-validated here through the same no-follow resolver the
 * promotion path uses: `..`, an absolute path, the promotion journal, and any
 * symbolic-link component are refused, so a hostile guest can write only inside
 * this run's own overlay directory.
 *
 * On a virtiofs host nothing calls this: the guest's writes already landed in
 * that directory. `workspace.review` and promotion therefore keep the exact
 * contracts they have — they read one directory, whichever way it was filled.
