 * Owner-only private state, proved the way the host proves it.
 *
 * POSIX answers with `uid` and mode bits, which `lstat` reports truthfully.
 * Windows reports neither — every mode comes back `0o666`-shaped and
 * `process.getuid` does not exist — so the same two checks there would either
 * fail closed on every load or pass vacuously. Privacy on Windows is a DACL,
 * and reading one needs Win32, so the state directory is created and verified
 * through the packaged native helper.
 *
 * The platform is a parameter rather than a read of `process.platform`, so both
 * arms are exercised from one host and neither can drift untested.
