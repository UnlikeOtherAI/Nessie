/**
 * A Kelpie CLI whose `describe` never answers — an mDNS sweep that hangs — so
 * detection has to stop it. It writes its own pid to NESSIE_TEST_PID_FILE
 * first, which lets a test see whether the process under a `.cmd` shim was
 * stopped too or left behind when only the shim's `cmd.exe` was.
 *
 * With NESSIE_TEST_CHILD_PID_FILE it also starts a sleeping process of its
 * own that holds describe's stdout, as a helper Kelpie started would, and
 * writes that pid there before its own.
