/**
 * What a Windows run of this suite has, and the stated reason a test that needs
 * more skips there instead of failing — or, for one that waits on a guest start
 * a refused state save never reaches, hanging the whole run. Each is `false` on
 * Linux and macOS, so nothing here changes what runs in CI.
 *
 * Executor state on Windows is owner-only through a DACL, which only the
 * packaged native helper sets and reads (`state-security.ts`): it runs for a
 * packaged runtime — `NESSIE_EXECUTOR_PACKAGED_CLI=1`, with
 * `nessie-executor-native.exe` beside the Node running the process — and a
 * development Node has neither. Those tests run on Windows the way
 * desktop-windows.yml runs `control-plane-e2e.test.ts`: under the installed
 * package's `node.exe`, or a copy of `node.exe` placed beside a helper built
 * with `cargo build --release` in `executor/native`, with the marker set.
 * `pnpm --filter @nessie/executor test` (`scripts/run-tests.mjs`) does the
 * latter by itself whenever that helper is built, for every file that names
 * `WINDOWS_STATE_HELPER_SKIP`, after the ordinary run in which they skip.
