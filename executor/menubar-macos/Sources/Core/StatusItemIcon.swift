/// The mark in the menu bar.
///
/// It is the executor's own plus (`assets/logo/nessie-executor-mark.svg`) — the
/// same mark the Windows tray shows beside the clock, so one machine's executor
/// looks like the same product on either operating system. It is not a system
/// glyph: the first version of this app drew `circle.dashed` and an
/// `exclamationmark.triangle`, and among fifteen other status items that read as
/// a loading spinner belonging to nobody — a person told us they could not find
/// the icon at all. Three rules came out of that, and all three are asserted
/// below:
///
/// 1. **Always the same mark, always filled.** Every state draws the same plus
///    and every state fills it. An earlier version stroked it instead, and
///    `markPath` is a composite of two crossing bars, so stroking outlined
///    *every* subpath — including the interior edges where the bars meet. At
///    18pt the mark dissolved into hairline loops. A stroked composite path can
///    never be the union outline; only a fill is.
/// 2. **State is said by tint and by a badge, not by a different picture.**
///    Stopped is the same mark at a lower tint. Attention is the mark plus a
///    dot, and it is the one state that moves: the mark steps aside by about a
///    sixth so the badge gets a corner of its own, because a dot laid over the
///    mark reads as part of it rather than as a badge.
/// 3. **Always a template image.** A template is masked and tinted by the system,
///    which is the only way an icon is legible on a light menu bar, a dark one,
///    a tinted desktop behind a translucent bar, and in Reduce Transparency.
///    It is also why the menu bar gets the plus's silhouette rather than its
///    four brand colours: the system draws a template in one tint, and a
///    coloured status item is the unreadable-on-a-tinted-bar defect above.
