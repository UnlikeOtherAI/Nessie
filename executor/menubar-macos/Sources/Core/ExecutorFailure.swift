/// (`packages/executor-manage/src/executor-daemon.ts`); to a person it names no
/// cause, no consequence and no remedy, and the honest response to it was "what

/// standard error and nothing else, so the code never reaches this process. The

/// and each mapping below names the code it stands for, so a message that
/// changes without this file changing falls through to the honest default rather
/// than mislabelling anything.
