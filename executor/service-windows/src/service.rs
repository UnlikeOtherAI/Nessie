//! The Windows service itself: `NessieExecutor`, displayed as "Nessie Executor".
//!
//! It runs as the virtual account `NT SERVICE\NessieExecutor` — no password, no
//! interactive logon, its own SID — and starts automatically at boot, which is
//! the whole point of the standalone package: the executor is online before
//! anybody logs in.
//!
//! Start does three things before it supervises anything, and refuses loudly if
//! any of them fails, because an executor that runs an unverified runtime is
//! worse than one that does not run: it checks its own Authenticode provenance,
//! verifies the packaged runtime against its manifest, and establishes the
//! owner-only DACL on its state root through the packaged native helper.
//!
//! Stop closes each daemon's parent-liveness pipe and then reports
//! `STOP_PENDING` with an advancing checkpoint every second for as long as a
//! daemon is still tearing its guests down. Nothing here ever calls
//! `TerminateProcess`.

/// What Services and the tray show. Nothing in the running service reads it —
/// the installer's authoring carries the same string — and the test below is
