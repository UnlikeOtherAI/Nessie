//! `nessie-executor-service.exe` — the standalone package's daemon host.
//!
//! Started by the Service Control Manager with no arguments, it becomes the
//! `NessieExecutor` service. It has exactly one other mode, and it exists for
//! the installer: `--join-hyperv-administrators` puts the virtual service
//! account into the Hyper-V Administrators alias, as a deferred custom action
//! after the service is created. Both modes and nothing else — a control surface
//! belongs on the pipe, where the DACL decides who reaches it.
//!
//! Everything except the Win32 modules also compiles and runs its tests on a
//! non-Windows host, deliberately: the protocol's validation, the manifest
//! rules, the lease decision and the argument builders are where the behaviour
//! lives, and a check that only ever runs on the release machine is a check
//! nobody runs. On such a host the service entry points are stubs, so almost
//! every item is unreachable — hence the one allow below, which is scoped to
//! that build alone and never applies to the shipped binary.
// A service has no console, and the installer runs this binary as a deferred
// custom action to join the Hyper-V alias; a console subsystem made that flash
// a window mid-install. The SCM entry point and the installer mode are the only
// two ways in, and neither has a console to write to.
