//! Owner-only state, established and proved through the packaged native helper.
//!
//! Windows reports no uid and `0o666`-shaped modes, so privacy here is a DACL
//! and reading one needs Win32. The executor already ships that adapter — the
//! helper's `secure-directory` and `verify-owner-only` commands — and the
//! service uses exactly those, so the state root it creates carries the same
//! DACL the CLI later insists on. Running as `NT SERVICE\NessieExecutor` makes
//! that DACL the service account plus SYSTEM, which is what keeps pairing
//! material out of every person's profile.
//!
//! The helper's bytes are pinned in the runtime manifest, verified before this
//! module is ever called; nothing here reaches for an executable beside it.
