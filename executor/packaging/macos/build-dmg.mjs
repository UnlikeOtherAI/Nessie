// Builds NessieExecutor_<version>_<arch>.dmg: the downloadable installer for the
// macOS menu bar app, which is how a person with no terminal reaches an
// executor's settings, what it may reach, and the tools it may run.
//
// The DMG is the macOS trust root, and unlike the Linux package it is one Apple
// itself vouches for: a `Developer ID Application` signature over a hardened
// runtime, a notarization ticket stapled to both the app and the image, and a
// Gatekeeper assessment that actually passes. That last check is the point — a
// successful `notarytool submit` says a ticket was issued, not that this
// artifact carries it.
//
// There is no third outcome. A host without those credentials may build only the
// development image, whose file name, volume name and closing banner all say it
// may not be installed. Nothing here ad-hoc signs and calls the result
// distributable: docs/standards/build-and-release.md → "macOS release-signing
// policy" is the rule, and this file is where it binds for this artifact.
