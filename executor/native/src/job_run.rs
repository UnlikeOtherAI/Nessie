//! `job-run -- <program> [arguments…]`: run one coding agent so that its whole
//! process tree dies with it.
//!
//! A coding session's host starts the agent through this command on Windows.
//! The helper creates a Job Object with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`,
//! starts the program suspended, assigns it to the job and only then lets it
//! run, so no instruction of the agent's executes outside the job and every
//! process it starts — a test server, a watcher, a `start /b` that its parent
//! has long since forgotten — is in the job too. The helper holds the job's
//! only handle. When it exits, for any reason, Windows closes that handle and
//! kills everything still in the job. That is the containment `taskkill /T`
//! cannot give: `/T` walks parent ids at the moment it runs, so it misses a
//! grandchild whose parent already exited.
//!
//! The helper exits when the program does, with the program's own exit code,
//! and stdin, stdout and stderr pass straight through: the host speaks to the
//! agent exactly as it would without the helper between them. It also holds
//! its own parent open, and when that process — the session host — dies, it
//! terminates the job at once, so a host that crashes never leaves an agent
//! editing a working tree nobody is watching.
//!
//! Only Windows has Job Objects. Every other host answers
//! `EXECUTOR_NATIVE_UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM`; POSIX hosts contain the agent with a
//! process group, a descendant sweep and, on Linux, a systemd user unit.
